Hi mate, 

So.

I think maybe need to try and understand Angular a bit more to get this to work. 

Spent quite a while trying different things but am probably missing something q fundamental. 

"Use the showDirectives (located in the root directory of this package is the showDirectives.txt file , just add the content of the file as a bookmark to your browser) 
scriplet to identify the prmSearchBarAfter directive which you will plugin to"

So I think this is asking us to do something like this - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-bookmarklets/

Which should end up with results like this -
https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/blob/master/help_files/showDirectives.png

Which I have got to work but dont really understand the point of it? And is this just to get the "key" for the directive we need to edit? So in this case
prmSearchBarAfter which we already know cos it tells us in the thing

Found that github which has all the instructions and is from the makers of the software - interestingly it tells you to do the "hello world" in a different way.
https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/blob/master/VIEW_CODE/js/README.md

"Edit the primo-explore/custom/js/custom.js file and add a component declaration for myInstitutionComponent and a component declaration for the prmSearchBarAfter directive

app.component('myInstitutionComponent', {
});
app.component('prmSearchBarAfter', {
});

Add the template property with your static message

app.component('myInstitutionComponent', {
    template: `<span style="margin-left: 40%;">Hello World</span>`
});

Add the template property with your component template (myInstitutionComponent)

app.component('prmSearchBarAfter', {
        bindings: {parentCtrl: `<`},
        template: `<my-institution-component></my-institution-component>`    
});

I tried doing this but also didnt work. 

Maybe you could see if you can work out how to get the directives.txt think to work as a bookmark and if you can interpret the other stuff more?!
Cos maybe it is saying you can just test this stuff by editing the custom.js in browser?

Also found this which is interesting - https://www.carli.illinois.edu/sites/files/i-share/documentation/Customization_with_Javascript_Berry.pdf
